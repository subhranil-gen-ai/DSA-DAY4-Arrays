# DSA-DAY4-Arrays
Search-based DSA problems using linear and binary search. Includes total occurrences, first/last index, next greater, all matching indices, and frequency-based logic.

# Core Problems (Search Using Linear & Binary Search)

- Linear Search
- Binary Search
- Count Frequency (Linear Search)
- First and Last Position of Target (Binary Search Variant)  
- Total Occurrences of Target
- Search in a Sorted Rotated Array
   - Using Linear Search
   - Using Binary Search
- Floor and Ceil of a Number in Sorted Array
   
# 📚 Concepts Practiced
- Linear and binary search patterns
- Searching in sorted arrays (ascending)
- Finding element positions and frequency
- Optimizing search space with low, high, and mid
- Interview-based logic for range & condition-based search
