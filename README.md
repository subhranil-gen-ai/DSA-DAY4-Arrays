# DSA-DAY4-Arrays
Search-based DSA problems using linear and binary search. Includes total occurrences, first/last index, next greater, all matching indices, and frequency-based logic.

# Core Problems (Search Using Linear & Binary Search)

- *Linear Search*  
   Scans the array from left to right to find the target.  
- *Binary Search*  
   Efficiently searches in a sorted array by dividing the range.  
- *Count Frequency (Linear Search)*  
   Counts how many times a target appears using a basic loop.  
- *First and Last Position of Target (Binary Search Variant)*  
   Finds the first and last index of a target in a sorted array.  
- *Total Occurrences of Target*  
   Uses binary search result to calculate total count of a target using:  
   last - first + 1  

# 📚 Concepts Practiced
- Linear and binary search patterns
- Searching in sorted arrays (ascending)
- Finding element positions and frequency
- Optimizing search space with low, high, and mid
- Interview-based logic for range & condition-based search
